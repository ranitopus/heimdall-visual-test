Issue document Template
=======================
> - We should make sure the descriptive summary in the Issue document is the same description listed in the `INDEX.md` topic that references that document.
> - When an Issue transitions from `UNSOLVED` to `SOLVED`, whe should make sure to move its reference in the `INDEX.md` from section `UNSOLVED` to section `SOLVED`.
> - Also, when an Issue transitions from `UNSOLVED` to `SOLVED`, we should make sure to explain in its document how was it solved, if the consumer should follow any steps to solve it, where in the project was it solved and in which version, etc.
>
> Copy the following content below as a template to a new file (name it in the format `0000.md`, for example) and modify/fill it according to what is needed.
