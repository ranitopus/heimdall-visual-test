2 - Schedule new deadline and rethink release scope for version 1.0.0-alpha 
===========================================================================

## Context
Straight to the point: we failed to accomplish the original schedule. Many months passed since the first planned deadline (July 31th, 2025), and the project doesn't seem closer to completion for version 1.0.0-alpha. Since the deadline already passed, we have no choice but to stablish a new deadline. Also, since the scope of the release has to be considered when thinking a new deadline, we also have to consider an adjustement to the release scope, so we don't stretch our schedule too much. Many things could be postponed or divided to not be a part of version 1.0.0-alpha.
